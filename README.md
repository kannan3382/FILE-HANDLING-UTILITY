# FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: KANNAN J

INTERN ID: CT04DH811

DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION:

Objective:

The objective of this internship task is to develop a Java-based File Handling Utility that performs fundamental operations on text files — specifically writing, reading, and modifying content — through a console-based interface. This task serves to demonstrate proficiency in core Java I/O programming and practical file manipulation using standard input/output streams.

Project Overview:

This utility is designed to streamline file operations, allowing users to create and manage text files directly from the command line. The program is structured using a menu-driven approach, where users can interactively select from the following functionalities:

Write to File:

Users can input multiple lines of text, which are then written to a specified file. The input ends when the user types "END", allowing for flexible and dynamic data entry.

Read from File:

This feature displays the contents of an existing text file. The program opens the file using buffered reading and prints each line to the console for the user to review.

Modify File:

Users can modify existing content in a file by specifying a word or phrase to be replaced (old text) and providing the replacement (new text). The file is read in full, modified in-memory, and written back with updated content.

Exit:

The application terminates cleanly and returns control to the user, ensuring a seamless experience.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java (Standard Edition – Java SE) Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Core Java I/O Classes: FileReader FileWriter BufferedReader Scanner

Exception Handling:

try-catch blocks are implemented to handle I/O exceptions, ensuring robustness and user-friendly error reporting.
